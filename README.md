- Draw a custom marble diagram

Subjects:

	- [x] Observable
	- [x] Subject
	- [x] BehaviorSubject
	- [x] ReplaySubject

- Combination operators:
	- [ ] combineLatest
	- [ ] withLatestFrom
	- [ ] merge

- Transformation operators:
	- [ ] map
	- [ ] scan
	- [ ] reduce
	- [ ] share
	- [ ] switchMap
	- [ ] concatMap
	- [ ] partition

- Filtering operators:
	- [ ] filter
	- [ ] take
	- [ ] throttle
	- [ ] debounce

- Creation functions:
 	- [ ] of
